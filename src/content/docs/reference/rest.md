title: REST API reference
description: Full BAPI + FAPI reference, generated from the OpenAPI spec.
---

The REST reference is generated from the [`authn-sh/openapi`](https://github.com/authn-sh/openapi) bundled spec. As of right now the openapi repo is still being scaffolded — once OA-1 lands the build pipeline pulls `openapi.bundled.json` from its tagged release and renders the full reference here.

In the meantime:

- **Backend API (BAPI)** — server-to-server, secret-key authenticated. Source: [`routes/bapi.php`](https://github.com/authn-sh/authn/blob/main/authn/routes/bapi.php).
- **Frontend API (FAPI)** — browser-facing, publishable-key + Client-cookie authenticated. Source: [`routes/fapi.php`](https://github.com/authn-sh/authn/blob/main/authn/routes/fapi.php).
- **`/.well-known/jwks.json`** — per-environment JWKS. Source: [`JwksController`](https://github.com/authn-sh/authn/blob/main/authn/app/Http/Controllers/WellKnown/JwksController.php).

## Conventions

- All timestamps are Unix milliseconds (numbers, not strings).
- All IDs are prefixed ULIDs — `user_…`, `sess_…`, `evt_…`. Treat as opaque strings.
- Errors follow the envelope `{ "errors": [{ "code", "message", "long_message", "meta" }], "trace_id" }`.
- Pagination is opaque cursor-based: `?cursor=<token>&limit=<n>`. Responses include `meta.next_cursor` when more rows exist.
